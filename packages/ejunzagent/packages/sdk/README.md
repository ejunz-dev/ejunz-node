# sdk/ — drive EjunzAgent runtimes from another process


This group contains the protocol stack for driving a EjunzAgent runtime from another process. Callers supply the runtime executable and its `cordis.yml`; this group does not create, configure, build, or launch developer projects. The TypeScript SDK decision owns the client contract, and the toolchain removal owns the product boundary.

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| [`protocol/`](protocol/README.md) | Defines the SDK runtime wire protocol |
| [`client/`](client/README.md) | Drives a EjunzAgent runtime through the TypeScript client API |
| [`server/`](server/README.md) | Serves out-of-process SDK clients over stdio JSON-RPC |
